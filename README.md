Churn Modelling with Python and Jupyter Notebook A guide to creating a churn model using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

Requirements Python 3.x Jupyter Notebook Pandas Numpy Matplotlib Scikit-Learn Introduction Churn modeling is a process used by companies to determine the likelihood of a customer leaving or churning. This information is used to improve customer retention and prevent churn.

In this guide, we will use a sample dataset to train and evaluate a churn model using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

Step 1: Importing the necessary libraries
Step 2: Loading the dataset
Step 3: Exploring the dataset
Step 4: Preprocessing the data
Step 5: Training the model
Step 6: Making predictions and evaluating the model
Conclusion With this guide, you should now have a basic understanding of how to create a churn model using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The code provided here is just a starting point and can be improved upon by experimenting with different algorithms and techniques.
